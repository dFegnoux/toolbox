# toolbox
A simple toolbox to call when needed :)

Hey ! Since I had to install and reinstall several times my PC, I found that putting useful aliases, zsh install process and other was a smart move.

**Install ZSH and adding aliases**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dFegnoux/toolbox.git
cd toolbox
/bin/bash ./zsh-install.sh
```
